It is a recommendation system project with moivelens https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/ 20M Dataset.
This work aims to accomplish a SVD Latent Factor approach towards a movie recommendation system. 
At present, this work has not been completed. However, it has been successful on http://files.grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/ml-latest-small.zip using tensorflow package with python.

Before 12/20 this work would be complete and I will launch codes then. Thank you for your support!
